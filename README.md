# SmartBoxCreator
SmartBoxCreator is an innovative project in computer vision and automation, designed to revolutionize product packaging. Utilizing advanced image processing algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques, this system is capable of analyzing objects in real-time to determine their exact dimensions. With this information, SmartBoxCreator calculates the optimal size of the cardboard box needed, generating a customized design that not only ensures protection during transportation but also optimizes material use and reduces waste. This repository hosts the source code and documentation necessary for building, from computer vision software to control modules for the cutting and assembly machinery of boxes. SmartBoxCreator is intended to transform packaging logistics, making the process more efficient, eco-friendly, and tailored to the specific needs of each product.
